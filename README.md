# mouseCheeseGame

This project was built in C++ using the openFrameworks toolkit. The aim was to create an application to tech the basics of coding to children.
In the game the child will give the mouse a set of instructions by clicking on the arrows, then they will press play in order for the little mouse to follow them.
The app had been tested on children between 3 years old and 8 years old. For the youngest one it was very challenging and only appealing to the ones more interested in counting.
The older children had to make it harder for themselves trying to make the mouse going around the grid before catching the cheese.
For the 4/6 years old the app seems appropriate as it is challenging and fun at the same time.
